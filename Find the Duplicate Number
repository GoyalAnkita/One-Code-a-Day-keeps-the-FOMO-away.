class Solution:
    def findDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
      
                dict_empty={}
        for i in nums:
            if i not in dict_empty:
                dict_empty[i]=1
            else:
                    return i
        

Time Complexity: O(n), passing all the testcases
Space Complexity: O(n) as we have created dictinary which is taken as an additional Data Structure.
